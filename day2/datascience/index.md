# Data Science in the Classroom

In this session we will do a hands-on activity with R.
R is a programming language and software environment, commonly used for statistical computing in Industry and Research.
This activity will introduce the R language and will involve working through an example of how R can be used to teach Data Science concepts.

## R

R has been described as "more than a programming language", and as an ["an interactive environment for doing statistics"](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/r_language_for_programmers/){:target="_blank"}.
It is used by many statisticians and data miners in Research and [Industry](http://www.revolutionanalytics.com/companies-using-r){:target="_blank"}.
R can be downloaded for free, and there are several IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) for R that are available to download for free.
In this session we will use the (free) IDE RStudio Desktop.

## Data Science

Data Science is a field that is rapidly growing and that is applicable to many domains, including: Education, Health and Commerce. 
The availability of high performance computers and more sophisticated ways of collecting data has paved the way for "Big Data".
There is currently [a high demand for Data Scientists](https://blog.pivotal.io/data-science-pivotal/news/mckinsey-report-highlights-the-impending-data-scientist-shortage){:target="_blank"}, and it is expected that this demand is likely to continue growing in the future.
