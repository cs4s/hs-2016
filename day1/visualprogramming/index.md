# Visual Programming & Physical Computing

In this session we will work through some hands-on activities using Scratch and Makey Makeys. 
These activities combine Visual Programming & Physical Computing concepts.

[Visual Programming & Physical Computing (Powerpoint Presentation)]()

## Visual Programming

**Visual Programming** languages are programming languages that allow you to create programs by manipulating graphical elements.
These languages are different to General-Purpose languages (also referred to as Text-Based languages), which you use to create programs by writing text.
Visual Programming languages are great for beginners learning about Computer Science and Coding.
This is because they allow students to focus on the writing of Algorithms and Computational Thought, rather than on the syntax and semantics of the language. 

In this session we will use a Visual Programming language called [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
Scratch is a tool for building interactive stories, animations and games, where you drag and drop blocks together to write programs. 
Scratch has a very large community of students and educators, and there are many resources available for it.
An alternative to Scratch, that does not have as large a community but that has some more advanced features, is [Snap!](http://snap.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

## Physical Computing

**Physical Computing** usually refers to designing and developing computer hardware and software that involves some physical interaction or the use of sensors.
This physical interaction could be a different way of interacting with the computer, that may not involve using a mouse and keyboard.
For example, playing a game, such as [Dance Central](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-iKWe-U9bY){:target="_blank"} that involves dancing in front of a camera with a motion sensor.
Sensors are often used to collect data from the "real world", for example: temperature, humidity and noise levels.

In this session we will focus on making programs that involve alternative forms of phyiscal interaction (i.e. not using a keyboard and mouse).
We will do some work with sensors in this afternoon's Robotics session.

You may have heard of [Arduinos](https://www.arduino.cc/){:target="_blank"} or [Rasbperry Pis](https://www.raspberrypi.org/){:target="_blank"}.
These are both small, cheap computers that can be used in a variety of Physical Computing projects.
In this session we will be using MaKey MaKeys, which you could say are a simpler version of these.
MaKey MaKeys are ["An Invention Kit for Everyone"](http://makeymakey.com/){:target="_blank"}. 

The increased availability of gadgets like MaKey MaKeys and 3D printers has spurred on the ["Maker Movement"](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/28408/maker-movement){:target="_blank"}.
This is encouraging for STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) education, because being a Maker usually involves using skills from all of these these disciplines to create a real, tangible invention.

## Activities

There are 2 activities in this session. We recommend that you complete them in order, as the first activity is a quick introduction to using Scratch.

### Introduction to Scratch

- [Introduction to Scratch - Tutorial (Word document)](introduction_to_scratch.docx)

### Interactive Quiz

- [Interactive Quiz - Tutorial (Word document)](quiz_activity.docx)
- [Interactive Quiz Resources (Zip)](quiz_resources.zip)

If you complete both of these activities, please let us know.
