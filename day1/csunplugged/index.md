# Computer Science Unplugged

As you know, Computer Science (CS) is not just about coding! 
Computational thinking and algorithmic thinking are at the core of CS and many of its principles can be taught without the aid of a computer.
The activities in this session are designed for ‘rainy days’ when things may go wrong and computers are not available.
The concepts covered in these activities, however, are fundamental for the high end of program design.
